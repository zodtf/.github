 
# `Z` `O` `D` **`TF`** Servers    
The organization is for you guys! If you can see this, I want to collaborate you with. Probably very closely. And I want to make cool things. _Obviously_, one of those things is money. But it is not the only thing.

### $PURPOSE$
This organization exists to provide good services. The key is not profit, though the more it can generate, the more time can be spent here. Regardless, our goal -- and indeed _my_ goal, is to **automate.**
